## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

It took me an hour and a half. I would improve the aesthetics, add pagination in case of large volume of data and add sorting and filtering by field.

## 2. What was the most useful feature added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I am not aware of the latest features added to Angular so I have not used them in the coding test

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

The best way would be to simulate massive loads to the application to check the response times and based on that determine the weak points. The times I've had to do it was mainly due to problems with database queries.

## 4. How would you improve the Lantek API that you just used?

I would add a new search service, answers ordered by manufacturer and name and would keep the services always online so all responses take a similar time.
